Yunnan Province in China leads the country in biodiversity and is one of the 34 biodiversity hotspots in the world with the richest species and the most threatened. At present, a total of 162 nature reserves in Yunnan, we closed provincial nature reserve in Yunnan Tongbiguan deployed 50 high-definition camera to observe.In early studies,we have built a rare wild animals that are going to be used in target detection task image dataset, we extracted the picture of the rare wild animals from the dataset again. Similar images from the same video clip were excluded, and those with high differences were retained. With the help of experts in the field, species labeling of rare wild animals was carried out, and finally a small sample rare wild animal image dataset was constructed. The dataset consists of 60 images of six animal groups, including Phayreâ€™s leaf-monkey, Malabar pied hornbill, Red-thighed Falconet, Wreathed hornbill, Skywalker hoolock gibbon, and Great Hornbill. Each animal has 10 images, all in png format. Since the six wild animals themselves live in the wild, their distinction from the environment is not obvious. In order to train the classification model with good generalization ability, we extract 70% of the dataset as the training set and 30% of the dataset as the test set. After that, we used cyclegan and cnn to complete the image classification task, achieving a good classification effect with a classification accuracy of 94.4%.
